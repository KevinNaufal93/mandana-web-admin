# Content Blocks — Web Admin Integration Guide

Audience: the admin panel — managing the homepage hero carousel and the
four service-strip cards through one unified CRUD surface. There is no
public endpoint for this data; the landing page reads it exclusively
through the cached `GET /homepage` payload — see
[docs/homepage-integration.md](homepage-integration.md) for that public
shape (`hero.slides` / `services`), which is unaffected by anything
below.

## 1. Base URL, auth & response envelope

All routes live under `/api/v1/admin/content-blocks`, spec at
`/docs-json` (tagged `admin / content-blocks`). Every route requires a
Bearer token for a user with the `admin` role —
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `POST /api/v1/auth/login`; a
non-admin (`editor`) token gets **403**. Responses are a bare array
under `data` — this resource isn't paginated (a handful of slides/cards,
same reasoning as event-support categories): `{ "data": [...] }` on the
list, `{ "data": {...} }` on create/update.

## 2. What a content block is

Hero slides and service-strip cards are the same underlying record on
the backend, distinguished by `type: "hero" | "service_card"`. That's an
implementation detail, not a UX mandate — build one admin screen or two,
whichever reads better; every write just needs the right `type` in the
body.

| Field | Hero slide | Service card |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Headline (required) | Card heading (required) |
| `subtitle` | Secondary line under the title | Card description |
| `ctaText` | CTA button label | *unused — omit it* |
| `link` | CTA target, e.g. `/properties?listingType=sale` | Card href, e.g. `/moving` |
| `mediaAssetId` | **Required** — a hero with no image is invalid | Optional — the 4 seeded cards ship with none, **required when `imageOnly: true`** |
| `imageOnly` | *unused — always `false`* | Optional (default `false`) — when `true`, the public site renders only the image, skipping the title/description text overlay, because the artwork already has that copy baked in |

`sortOrder` and `isActive` apply to both — see §6.

## 3. Endpoints

`GET /?type=` · `POST /` · `PATCH /:id` · `DELETE /:id`

```jsonc
// GET /api/v1/admin/content-blocks?type=hero →
{ "data": [
  { "id": "uuid", "type": "hero", "title": "Hunian Premium di Jakarta",
    "subtitle": "Temukan rumah impian Anda", "ctaText": "Lihat Properti",
    "link": "/properties?listingType=sale", "mediaAssetId": "uuid",
    "image": { "url": "...", "srcset": "...", "srcsetAvif": "...",
               "placeholder": "data:image/webp;base64,...", "alt": null,
               "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },
    "sortOrder": 0, "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." } ] }
```

Omit `?type` to list every block together — ordered by `type`, then
`sortOrder`, then `createdAt`, so an unfiltered table renders all hero
rows before all service-card rows. `sortOrder` is only meaningful
**within** a type, not as one global sequence. There's no `isActive`
filter — this endpoint always returns both active and inactive rows;
render the toggle state yourself.

```jsonc
// POST /api/v1/admin/content-blocks →
{ "type": "service_card", "title": "Moving Support",
  "subtitle": "Layanan pindahan aman, cepat, dan terpercaya.",
  "link": "/moving", "sortOrder": 4 }
// → 201, same shape as the GET item above ("image": null — no icon attached yet)
```

`PATCH /:id` accepts any subset of the same fields — send only what
changed. Pass `"mediaAssetId": null` explicitly to clear a service
card's icon (rejected with 400 on a hero — see §4). `type` itself is
patchable, but converting a card into a hero (or back) is rarely what
you actually want — the hero-requires-image rule is checked against the
row's *resulting* state, whichever fields the request included.

`DELETE /:id` — **204**. This removes the content-block row only — the
underlying media asset is untouched and stays in the library (§7).

## 4. The hero-requires-image rule

`type: "hero"` with no `mediaAssetId` is rejected — on `POST`, on any
`PATCH` that would leave a hero without one (explicitly sending
`mediaAssetId: null`, or `PATCH`ing `type` to `"hero"` on a row with no
image), and one layer deeper by a database constraint that holds even if
every application-level check were somehow bypassed:

```jsonc
// 400 →
{ "statusCode": 400, "timestamp": "...", "path": "/api/v1/admin/content-blocks",
  "error": { "message": "A hero content block requires an image (mediaAssetId).",
             "error": "Bad Request", "statusCode": 400 } }
```

To replace a hero's image, include the new `mediaAssetId` in the same
`PATCH` that would otherwise remove the old one — don't null it out
first.

## 5. Uploading and attaching images

Content blocks don't accept a file directly. Upload first, then
reference the id it returns:

```
POST /api/v1/admin/media/upload   (multipart: file, purpose, alt?)
  → { "data": { "id": "uuid", ... } }
POST /api/v1/admin/content-blocks
  → { ..., "mediaAssetId": "<that id>" }
```

Use `purpose: "hero"` for slides, `"cover"` for service-card
illustrations (`"icon"` is for small transparent glyphs used elsewhere
in the API, not here). **The upload response's `variants` are raw
storage keys, not URLs** — don't try to render it directly; either use
the picker's own local preview for the just-uploaded file (same as
`components/media/image-picker.tsx` already does), or re-fetch through
one of the endpoints in this doc, which all return a built `image`.

Every content-block response (list, create, update) carries a
ready-to-render `image` object once `mediaAssetId` is set — same shape
as everywhere else in this API:

- `srcsetAvif` is `""` for `cover`-purpose images (service cards) — AVIF
  is only generated for `hero`-purpose uploads. Render a `<picture>`
  avif `<source>` only when it's non-empty.
- `placeholder` is a small base64 `data:` URI — paint it immediately and
  cross-fade the real image in once it loads (blur-up). Can be `null`
  on an asset uploaded before this field existed.
- `alt` comes from the media asset itself (set once, at upload time via
  `UploadMediaDto.alt`) — there's no separate per-content-block alt text
  field, so re-attaching the same image to a different slide reuses the
  same alt.
- `image` is `null` only for a service card with no icon attached yet.

## 6. Ordering and visibility

No bulk-reorder endpoint exists yet — after a drag-and-drop reorder,
`PATCH` every row whose `sortOrder` actually changed. Values don't need
to be contiguous or unique; ties break by creation order.

`isActive: false` hides a block from the public `/homepage` payload
(`HomepageService` only reads active rows) without deleting it or
detaching its image — use it to unpublish a slide/card temporarily
instead of deleting and re-creating it later.

## 7. Media library cleanup

Deleting a content block never deletes its image — `media_assets` rows
are independent and can be attached to more than one thing. To find
images no longer referenced by anything (including content blocks), use
the admin media library:

```
GET /api/v1/admin/media?unused=true&withUsage=true   → candidates for cleanup
GET /api/v1/admin/media?purpose=hero                  → browse/pick by purpose
DELETE /api/v1/admin/media/:id                        → 409 if still referenced
```

Deleting a media asset that a content block (or any other owning record)
still references returns **409** — detach it first.

**As of this admin module's build, `GET /admin/media` does not exist on
the deployed API** — only upload and delete are wired up
(`lib/api/media.ts`). Browsing/cleanup per this section is not yet
possible from the admin UI; see this repo's `docs/api-property-images.md`
for the shape of a backend-change write-up if that's picked up later.

## 8. Errors

Same envelope as the rest of the API:

```jsonc
{ "statusCode": 409, "timestamp": "...", "path": "...",
  "error": { "message": "...", "error": "Conflict", "statusCode": 409 } }
```

Expect **404** on any `:id` that doesn't exist, **400** on validation
failures (missing `title`, invalid `type`, malformed UUID, or §4's hero
rule), and **403** on a non-admin token.
